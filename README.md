# py2gcode_adapted
This is an adaptation of the py2gcode function written by Alejandro Ibarra  (https://github.com/AlejandroIbarraO/py2gcode) in the case of the deposition of liquid lines

The py2gcode script is just an updated version

The others are specific functions to create G-code for lines deposition
